# MCU_LAB1
Lab1 of MCU
This lab is a manual that guides the user through the process of programming an ARM microcontroller using the STM32CubeIDE to create LED animations. It includes step-by-step instructions and exercises that teach the user how to simulate LED animations on Proteus. The lab is designed to be accessible to beginners and does not require any prior knowledge or prerequisites.
### Exercise 1
In this exercise, the user will connect one more LED to the STM32 microcontroller and switch the status of two LEDs every 2 seconds.

### Exercise 2
This exercise builds on Exercise 1 and introduces the concept of using timers to control the timing of LED animations.

### Exercise 3
In this exercise, the user will learn how to use interrupts to control the timing of LED animations.

### Exercise 4
This exercise builds on Exercise 3 and introduces the concept of using buttons to control the LED animations.

### Exercise 5
In this exercise, the user will learn how to use PWM to control the brightness of an LED.

### Exercise 6
This exercise builds on Exercise 5 and introduces the concept of using PWM to create fading LED animations.

### Exercise 7
In this exercise, the user will learn how to use the ADC to read analog values from a potentiometer and use them to control the brightness of an LED.

### Exercise 8
This exercise builds on Exercise 7 and introduces the concept of using the ADC to create a color mixer.

### Exercise 9
In this exercise, the user will learn how to use the UART to communicate with a computer and send data.

### Exercise 10
This exercise builds on Exercise 9 and introduces the concept of using the UART to control the LED animations from a computer.
